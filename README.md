# AlgorithmFundamentals_in_Java
This is a direct code translation of the Algorithms Fundamentals code from Python to Java

I made this git primarily to spend my time in military doing something useful for my life. As I am studying basics of algorithms
I will be translating the source code written in python to java. I hope that this code helps those who are interested in starting
to code algorithms as I plan to write a lot of comments.

In addition, I will try to answer some of the textbook question if time allows.
